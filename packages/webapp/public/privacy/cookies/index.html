      <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small pieces of data stored in text files that are saved on
        your computer or other devices when websites are loaded in a browser.
        They are widely used to remember you and your preferences, either for a
        single visit (through a &quot;session cookie&quot;) or for multiple
        repeat visits (using a &quot;persistent cookie&quot;).
      </p>
      <p>
        Session cookies are temporary cookies that are used during the course of
        your visit to the Website, and they expire when you close the web
        browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        Persistent cookies are used to remember your preferences within our
        Website and remain on your desktop or mobile device even after you close
        your browser or restart your computer. They ensure a consistent and
        efficient experience for you while visiting the Website and Services.
